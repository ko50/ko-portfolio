## **Hello, someone who came to see my portfolio!**

This is [ko50](https://github.com/ko50)'s portfolio site that written with React(TypeScript).

<br />

## Branches

### dev

Main branch. All React files exist in this branch.

#### Directory Structure

- `public`: Includes favicon, index.html, logo, manifest.json etc.
  - `langIcon`: Includes svg icons used for "Language Skills" part.

<br />

### master

Static web page files generated by `yarn build` exist.

#### Directory Structure

- `static`: Static CSS and JS files exist. 
- `./`: index.html and site logo, favicon etc.

<br />

### gh-pages

This branch has no specific role. <br />
But a yarn package `gh-pages` generates static web page files in this branch automatically. <br />
So, this branch seems the same as the `master` branch.

#### Directory Structure

(Maybe) Same as `master` branch's one.
